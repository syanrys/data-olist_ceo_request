🏋️‍♀️ Time to answer our CEO's request!

## Problem

>❓ How many underperforming sellers should Olist remove to improve its profit, given that it has:
> - some revenues per sellers per months
> - some revenues per orders
> - some reputation costs (estimated) per bad reviews
> - some operational costs of IT system that grows with number of order items, but not linearly (scale effects)

  <summary markdown='span'>💡 Hints</summary>
- You may want to compute the review cost of each order first, then sum these costs by seller.

## ✏️ Your turn!

👉 **Open the `CEO_request.ipynb` notebook and start from there.**

- We'll start from a new Notebook
- Don't re-use from previous notebooks - they were made for investigation only
- All your re-usable logic is coded in `olist/*.py` scripts
